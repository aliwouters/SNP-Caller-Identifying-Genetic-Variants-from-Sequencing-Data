# SNP-Caller-Identifying-Genetic-Variants-from-Sequencing-Data
This two-part project involved developing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) caller to identify and characterize genetic variation in a specific individual based on sequencing data. In Part 1, the task was to extract sequencing reads from a BAM file that overlapped known putative SNP positions. For each SNP position, the observed bases, their corresponding quality scores (Phred scores), and the read identifiers were collected. This enabled the detection of variation at a single-nucleotide level by directly examining sequencing evidence. In Part 2, the objective was to estimate the genotype probabilities (AA, AB, BB) for each SNP site using the data collected in Part 1. A probabilistic model was implemented to compute posterior genotype probabilities based on observed base calls and their associated quality scores. The approach included the use of log probabilities and the log-sum-exp trick to ensure numerical stability during inference. The final outputs were formatted as structured tables summarizing read-level observations and genotype likelihoods, enabling downstream population-level or individual-level genomic analysis.
